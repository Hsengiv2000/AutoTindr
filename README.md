# AutoTindr
TinderAutomation but front end not yet implemented. Back end works flawlessly though. made for NTU intuition hackathon. Made with a team of 3 others.
The project works beautifully for the back end however we will work on front end after term gets over. Code is slightly messy due to it being a hackathon but it will be fixed later.
